# Practice Exercise

## Group Hangman

Based on the demo we have seen in the class we would like to complete the rest of the features of a hangman game (just like week1 project)

then you are requested to look for features that you could implement in this version that are not possible in the terminal version
and then discuss this with the current instructor
